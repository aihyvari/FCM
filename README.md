# FCM

Some R codes related to my work with FCMs (Fuzzy Cognitive Maps).

The central idea of FCMs is to include a set of interrelated concepts into the model and to present their causal effects. Mathematically FCMs can be represented as directed graphs. The nodes of the graph are the concepts and the arcs connecting the nodes represent the strengths of the connections.
